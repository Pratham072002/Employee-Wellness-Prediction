# Employee-Wellness-Prediction
A drastic thing happened and XYZ Technical Solutions have lost one of their important employees. The company is now very concerned about the health of their employees and would want you to find that set of employees who are in need or may be in need of treatment, taking into account multiple attributes that are already stored in the database. So buckle up, the wellness of your employees is in your hand.

The goal is to help the organization to better understand the factors that contribute to employee health and wellbeing. By developing accurate predictive models, participants can help multiple organizations to identify areas where interventions may be needed, and to design targeted wellness programs that can improve employee health and productivity. The objective is to predict if the employee needs treatment, from the given features of the Test data.

The predictions are to be written to a CSV file along with ID which is the unique identifier for each
tuple.
Please upload the submission file to get a score.
Please note that the training data is only for creating your data model and all predictions are to be
